This code is used to power [AddressData.net](https://AddressData.net), a site that displays all known addresses by city, alongside an interactive map.

Currently, [AddressData.net](https://AddressData.net) contains millions of addresses for over 1,500 cities around the world.

## Installation

### How to run

2. ```bash
   docker build -t addressdatanet ./src
   docker run -it -p 8001:8001 addressdatanet
   ```
2. The API can be accessed at [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001).
